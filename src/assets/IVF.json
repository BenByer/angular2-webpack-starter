  "quote": "If I could sum up the Biznas difference in three words I would say, \"partnerships over projects\".  They don't want to - and in fact won't - sell you large untested and costly Apps which often miss the mark and need significant redevelopment.  Instead they help you focus on identifying the minimum product you need to validate your idea.  That means less money upfront and a greater likelihood of success at launch.  That success feeds user growth and generates incremental value which can be invested in future versions.  I have saved tens of thousands of dollars in development dollars partnering with the Biznas team but more importantly I have an App people want to use.",
